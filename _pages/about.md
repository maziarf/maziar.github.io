I'm a 5th year PhD student at the Department of Mathematics, University of Toronto. I work on mathematical physics under the supervision of [Prof. Marco Gualtieri](https://www.math.toronto.edu/mgualt/). 

You can find [my CV here](https://maziarf.github.io/files/My_CV.pdf). 

I have been working on developing discrete models of geometric spaces with metrics and of physical systems similar to lattice field theory e.g. scalar field theory and Yang-Mills. 

Here, you can see me giving a talk on a recent paper in my field: [Quantum Field Theory on Graphs](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/talks/Combinatorial-QFT-Graphs).
